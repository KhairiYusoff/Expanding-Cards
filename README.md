# Expanding-Cards

Expanding cards display an expanded view of the card on click. For creating this card I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. Create a div with the class container.
2. Create 5 childs div inside a container with the class panel and active.
3. Style the 5 divs panel with a background image. Set flex =0.5.
4. Make a .active class inside the styles.css file. Set flex = 5.
5. By using JS array method forEach, we need to loop through the selected divs. 
6. Use the classList property to remove and add the .active class.

From this simple project, I learnt the important concept in JS, array method (forEach).
